PerlRDF-NG Development Repository
=================================

This repo contains in-development work on the next-generation PerlRDF APIs.
We're trying to focus on simplifying the APIs at the same time as we move to
a moose-based implementation. This code is in a *very* early stage of
development, so don't rely on any of the APIs being stable. If you have
comments, suggestions, or want to help out, feel free to file issues,
fork the code, submit pull requests, or drop by [our irc channel](irc://irc.perl.org/perlrdf).
